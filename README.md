# Python Quiz Game

## What's This All About?

I put together a nifty little Python quiz app that serves up questions and checks your answers against the ones it's got stored. It's a straightforward game where your correct guesses rack up points on the scoreboard.

## Cool Stuff My Game Does

- Snags questions and their answers right out of a plain text file
- Shuffles the questions each time for a fresh experience
- Tally up your wins and whoopsies
- Zaps right back with feedback after each answer
- Built using nothing but the good ol' Python standard library

## Installation

Clone the project using the following command:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/irnaasllani/irnaasllani.git
]
