# Python Quiz Game

## What's This All About?

I put together a nifty little Python quiz app that serves up questions and checks your answers against the ones it's got stored. It's a straightforward game where your correct guesses rack up points on the scoreboard.

## Cool Stuff My Game Does

- Snags questions and their answers right out of a plain text file
- Shuffles the questions each time for a fresh experience
- Tally up your wins and whoopsies
- Zaps right back with feedback after each answer
- Built using nothing but the good ol' Python standard library

## Getting Started

Want to give it a whirl? Just clone it down like this:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/irnaasllani/irnaasllani.git

## Jump into the game directory with:

```bash
cd irnaasllani

## Kick things off with:

python src/main.py

## Need a Hand?

Hit a snag? Got a brainwave? Drop your thoughts in the [issue tracker here](URL to your repository issues page) or shoot me an email at [irna.asllani@gmail.com].

## Looking Ahead

Here's what I'm thinking of adding down the line:

- A scoreboard to see who's the quiz whiz
- Even more brain-busting questions
- Maybe even toss in some multiple-choice questions for kicks
